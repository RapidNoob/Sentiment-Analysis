# Newspaper-Sentiment-Analysis [Not Actively Maintained]
## What is sentiment Analysis?
    Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and           biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.
   Here I used textblob algorithum for analysis.
